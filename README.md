# 🍺🍺🍺 BeerSmith 3 Starter 🍺🍺🍺

A simple launcher script for BeerSmith 3 on Linux.

This script helps run BeerSmith 3 on modern Linux environments by working around some common quirks.

## Current fixes
- **Dark theme issues**: BeerSmith 3 does not render pleasantly under dark themes – enforce a common light theme
- **Nvidia/Wayland crash workaround**: Disable explicit CPU/GPU sync to prevent protocol error 71 startup crash on some Nvidia/Wayland setups.

Relax, and have a homebrew!
